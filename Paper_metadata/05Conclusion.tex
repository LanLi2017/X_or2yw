A scientific workflow system is supposed to capture metadata indicating which specific data products and tools are used to create a derived data products, and automatically record the sequence of applied processes, parameter settings, and intermediate data products \cite{ludascher2006scientific}. Hybrid provenance proposed by this paper is composed of computational steps, metadata including transformation functions and parameter settings, and log of intermediate cell values. By querying the hybrid provenance at the cell level, we promise its completeness, transparency. Reversibility of the whole data cleaning task promises the reproducibility and trustworthiness of this hybrid provenance. From dataset history to cell provenance, the hybrid provenance repairs the broken dependency issue. Or2yw toolkit, a bridge between the data cleaning recipe in OpenRefine and Yesworkflow system, helps reveal the recipe's dependency relationships.
